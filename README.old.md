# Overview
The intention of this application is to capture the time spending on specific activities.

# Requirements

**UI:**
- Clock in/clock out panel. This panel can work in 2 modes: 

    - Start an activity. User can enter a description of an activity and click on a start button. This action will add a new record in the activity history.
    - Stop an activity. User can see a description of the current activity and have a stop button. By click on this button, a record in the activity history will be updated with an end time.
- Activity grid panel. This panel should show a grid with 4 columns: start time, end time, duration, description.
If an activity is still in progress, end time should be empty and duration should reflect the current duration of this activity.

**Data storing:**

Store the list of activities in the browser session storage.

**Framework:**

Use React with vanilla JS or TypeScript.
